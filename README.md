### Question 1:

**Assume that in your API call you received a 401 status code. Which part of your code most probably is not correct?**

If you receive a 401 status code in your API call, it typically indicates an authentication issue. The most probable parts of your code that could be incorrect include:

1. **API Key:** Make sure that the API key you provided in your code is valid and properly formatted. A 401 status code is often returned when the provided API key is missing, incorrect, or has expired.

2. **Authentication Headers:** Check that the authentication headers (e.g., `'X-RapidAPI-Key'` and `'X-RapidAPI-Host'`) are correctly set with the required values for your chosen API. They must match the API provider's expectations.

3. **Endpoint URL:** Ensure that the URL you are using to make the API request is correct and that it points to the API service you intend to use.

4. **Request Parameters:** Verify that you are providing all the required parameters and values that the API expects in the request.

Double-check these parts of your code to resolve the 401 status code issue.

### Question 2:

**Explain your design choices and how you used CSS to realize those changes.**

In designing the user interface for the weather app, several design choices were made to enhance user experience and make the application visually appealing. Here are some of the design choices and the role of CSS in realizing them:

1. **Layout and Typography:** CSS was used to define the layout of the page and set the typography. For instance, the choice of font family, font size, and line spacing were adjusted to make the text content readable and visually pleasing.

2. **Colors:** CSS was utilized to select a color scheme that is both aesthetically pleasing and provides good contrast. Background colors, text colors, and button colors were carefully chosen to ensure readability and a consistent visual style.

3. **Button Styling:** The "Get Weather" button was styled to make it visually prominent. CSS was used to define the button's appearance, including its size, background color, and hover effects.

4. **Form Input Styling:** The text input field in the form was styled using CSS to make it user-friendly. This includes defining the size, padding, border, and placeholder text appearance.

5. **Card-Like Design:** The weather information display area was given a card-like design using CSS. This provides a visually separated and organized space for presenting weather details.

6. **Error Handling:** CSS was used to style error messages for a better user experience. When there is an error in fetching weather data, the error message is styled to be noticeable and distinguishable from regular content.

7. **Responsive Design:** CSS media queries were used to ensure that the application is responsive to different screen sizes. This ensures that the weather app is accessible and usable on various devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

These design choices were made to create a user-friendly and visually appealing weather app. CSS played a crucial role in implementing these design decisions by defining the styles, colors, layout, and responsiveness of the user interface.
